This is a note on how to enable C++17 in CLion 2018.1 on macOS 10.13.

First of all, `GCC` or `CLang` compiler with C++17 support must be installed on the system (macOS).
Install `gcc` 7.3 (or later) using `Homebrew` with command `brew install gcc`. It can be accessed via `g++-7`.

To set `g++-7` as C++ default compiler in `CLion` go to **CLion->Preferences...->Build, Execution, Deployment->CMake->CMake Options** and add `-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-7 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-7`. 

In project's `CMakeLists.txt` the following lines must be inserted `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` (which is equal to `-std=c++17`) and `target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} stdc++fs)` (to link library with `std::experimental::filesystem` functions and types.)
