Control system based on `MB90f591G` microcontroller for automatic air ventilation.

`Forced Air Ventilation Control System` is an educational project which provides an understanding on how to build a control system based on microcontroller and a set of different sensors. The project's purposes are: training of microcontroller programming, selection of sensors and other components, voltage levels synchronization, creation of principal schemes, usage of datasheets.

The task:

- The controller is designed to turn on the fan when a person enters the room. The fan power is **100W**.

- The fan turns on only if the room temperature is higher than the user-defined temperature ( which is done on a control panel ).

- The fan must be switched on at the moment of the mains voltage transition through zero.

- Fan shutdown occurs when the temperature drops below the user-defined temperature or after the last person leaves a room with a delay of 10 minutes.

- The device must be implemented on the microcontroller [MB90F591G](http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/394082/FUJITSU/MB90F591G.html).

The [report](https://github.com/Galarius/forsvent/blob/master/refman.tex) was built with `LaTeX`, and the program was written in `C` programming language. Report was written in Russian, but the program contains comments in English language.
