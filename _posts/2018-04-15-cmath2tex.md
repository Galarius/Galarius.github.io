Auto generation of LaTeX math equations from C source code.

I usually use `Doxygen` to generate a project documentation. As this tool relies on code's comments, it may take more time that might be available to cover the whole project with comments, especially if there are a lot of maths in the code. My colleagues and I decided to simplify this process by introducing a helper tool to automatically convert math formulas written in `C` programming language into `LaTeX` syntax, that `Doxygen` understands. We called it [**CMath2Tex**](https://github.com/Galarius/cmath2tex).

`CMath2Tex` contains regex-based formula detector and lexical analyzer to perform syntax transformations.

For now it recognizes **C** functions and types listed in [http://en.cppreference.com/w/c](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c), handles `operator[]` and underscores  (which must be escaped in LaTeX). The program is developed under `macOS` in `C++`, but is set-up to be highly portable. It may be built and run on `Windows` and on a variety of `Unix` flavors as well.

To install the latest version of `CMath2Tex` on `macOS` using `Homebrew`:

```
brew tap galarius/cmath2tex
brew install cmath2tex
```

To build `CMath2Tex` from the source code ( [![](/assets/icons/octocat-icon.png)GitHub](https://github.com/Galarius/cmath2tex) ):

```
git clone https://github.com/galarius/cmath2tex.git
cd cmath2tex
mkdir build  && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make && make install
```

The tool can be used in the following way:

* `cmath2tex.exe <input.[h,c]> <output.[h,c]>` to generate output.h or output.c with doxygen-style comments

* `cmath2tex.exe <input.[h,c]> <output.tex>` to generate simple LaTeX document with all detected formulas

* `cmath2tex.exe -i` - interactive mode

To extend functionality the following files can be modified:

* `cmath2tex/main/src/processing.cpp` - to add transformation rules

* `cmath2tex/main/src/lexeme.cpp` - to extend/modify syntax library
